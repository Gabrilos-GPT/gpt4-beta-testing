It's simple to setenv.

```export GITHUB_TOKEN="<github token>"``` (git bash)

```set GITHUB_TOKEN=<github token>``` (Windows CMD)

Don't get too excited, I'm just trying this out + it doesn't work as promised.

```ImportError: cannot import name 'OpenAI' from partially initialized module 'openai' (most likely due to a circular import) (c:\Users\Gabriel\Desktop\gpt4-beta-testing\openai.py)```
